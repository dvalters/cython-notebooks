    "Before being run, a Python code is automatically compiled to Python _bytecode_. Bytecodes are a set of fundamental codes and instructions that can be understood or executed by the Python virtual machine (VM). As the Python VM abstracts away any platform-specific details, python bytecode can be generated on one platform and run anywhere else with a Python VM.\n",

    "In Cython, __untyped dynamic variables__ behave exactly like Python variables. The assignment `b = a` allows both `a` and `b` to access the same list object. Modifying the list item with `b[3]` modifies the same list object item referenced by `a`, so th assertion holds true. When `a` is assigned to `13`, `b` still refers to the original list object, and `a` is assigned to a Python integer object. The type of `a` has been changed dynamically, which is perfectly valid Python code.\n",
